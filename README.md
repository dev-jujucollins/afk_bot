# afk_bot

This is a simple script that detects if you're away from the keyboard/inactive for a certain period of time, and will move the cursor for you after a set amount of time being inactive.

This script uses pyautogui to detect cursor movement, and move the cursor when inactive. 
Install pyautogui via pip3. Ex: pip3 install pyautogui
